* [mongoose create empty array](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20713650/mongoose-creating-empty-arrays)
* finally get the bunch of code to work
    > first get all article then get the sub document use promise
    
    yes, when I finally get this to work I found that I can't decide which article is top. stupid me, lesson learned: **first make sure algorithm work, then do the coding**

* finish index algorithm: get all the doc then do the structuring part, cause I have to get the doc anyway.
